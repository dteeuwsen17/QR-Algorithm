# QR-Algorithm
School project that gives a demonstration of the QR algorithm.
This was the final assignment for a second year undergraduate course called Math Integrated with Computers and Applications. The user interface design and display was completed by Megan Fisher (Reynolds) and the programming of the mathematics and algorithm was completed by Daniel Teeuwsen and can be found in form1.vb. The QR algorithm is an iterative procedure in linear algebra used to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. The algorithm uses a numerically stable form of the Gram Schmidt process to factor a matrix into the product of an orthogonal matrix and an upper diagonal matrix. Then, taking the product of the two factors in reverse this new matrix is once again factored. By iterating this process the two factors will converge to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the original matrix. Further details are explained in the summary PDF attached.
